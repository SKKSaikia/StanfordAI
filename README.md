# Stanford AI œü

Stanford is beautiful and majestic; In the heart of Silicon Valley, there lies the mystical and wonderful farm , /University once I called home. I studied a quarter at Stanford [[My Experience]](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/StanfordSS) and STANFORD‚ù§ will forever remain close to my heart. Here, in this blog, let's concentrate AI @ Stanford. The home of Stanford Cardinal; The place that gave me so much; is also the home of Computer Vision Group ; NLP group; AI group and many more. The Computer Science building is known as the GATES COMPUTER SCIENCE building and houses every CS research groups. Let's begin with <b><h>#AI</h></b> @ STANFORD.

CS229 : [Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) | Or Coursera's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)<br/>
CS231n : [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) - [Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)<br/>
CS224n : [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) - [Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6)<br/>
CS228 : [Probabilistic Graphical Models](http://pgm.stanford.edu/) or Coursera's [PGM Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models)

++ lot more exciting courses :) Also [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by Prof Andrew NG is great :)

# AI RESEARCH GROUPS @ STANFORD

# [STANFORD Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu/)
- [Stanford ML group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/)

# [STANFORD Vision and Learning LAB](http://svl.stanford.edu/)

[Stanford Vision Lab](http://vision.stanford.edu/) | [NLP group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/)

Stanford BS in CS with AI Specialization | MS ; SCPD ; [certificates](https://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=1226717) are exciting :)

While I was studying the Summer Quarter at Stanford, it was great to be in the labs | AI and Vision Lab :)
